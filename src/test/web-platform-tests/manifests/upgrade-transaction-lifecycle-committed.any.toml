# The `transaction.addEventListener('complete'` function in the "in the complete event handler for a committed transaction" test is running before the `transaction.addEventListener("complete"` function in FDBFactory.ts. If the opposite were true, then _runningVersionchangeTransaction would be set to false before the test's function runs, and then the test would pass.
