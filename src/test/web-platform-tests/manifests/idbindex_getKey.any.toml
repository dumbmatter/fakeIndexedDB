# Fails because FDBTransaction._abort synchronously sends out error events to open requests, when it should be
# asynchronous according to the spec. Making it asynchronous causes other tests to fail though. Need to be more
# careful about making sure other asynchronous things are actually asynchronous, and also "asynchronous" doesn't
# just mean "wrap in setImmediate", in this context it means to wait until prior requests are complete and then
# execute.
