# Various failures due to not perfectly matching the WebIDL, e.g.:
# - Different function names, e.g. `FDBRequest` vs `IDBRequest`
# - Not using native `Event`/`EventTarget`, e.g. `IDBRequest.prototype` should be `EventTarget.prototype`
# - Not having a property defined at the right part of the prototype chain, e.g. `FDBVersionChangeEvent.oldVersion`
