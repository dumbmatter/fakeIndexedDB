These tests come from [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/IndexedDB), last copied in March 2020 from commit [`216d5a68f63728a9c44e7d6f841b63c4c31c144a`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/commit/216d5a68f63728a9c44e7d6f841b63c4c31c144a).

To update them, clone that repo, copy over the IndexedDB folder, remove `converted/`, and run the convert.js script. Assuming nothing substantial has changed in the structure of the tests, that should be all you have to do.
